## Getting Started

### How to use?
you must add 
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/khoshghalb2c/typing@main/main.js"></script>
```
to end of `body` tag in `HTML` or add it end of `head` tag in `HTML` and call `Styping(Object, Integer)` and give a Object(*The object you want to be typed*) and a Integer(*Duration of writing each letter*) to it to type that Object.

**Notice!** You must set `Object.innerHTML`; then call the `Styping(...)` and give to it, that `Object`.

**Notice2!** You must use `^` instead of `\n` and `<br/>` to enter.
